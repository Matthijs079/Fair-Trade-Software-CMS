# Fair-Trade-Software-CMS

The CMS is the backend for the webshop here you can see all the orders and the active members.

### button

This is a file for the button componend. 
I have made a few changes to the button so it is according to design and is more user friendly.

### draggable

The draggable was a nice function. On the CMS you can make your own pages and on the pages there where textfield you could drag and drop.
If you made a page I was automatically for the looks of the new page so I made the LogoModule for the logos that are on thepage.

### Orders

In the orderView do you have a table with a summary with all the orders I made this page and if tou want the details of that order
You can click the order and it goes to the orderdetail page here I made the styling and the connection to the API
so you can see all the information of that order.
